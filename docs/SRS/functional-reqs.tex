\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{System must serve the user interface as a web page}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The web UI must be accessible on localhost and from the network
    \item The UI must include the following elements
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Earth Frame View display
      \item Vehicle Attitude (local tangent) display
      \item Telemetry data
      \item Video Views
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Video stream sources TBD
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System shall process and display video streams}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item System shall define a video format
    \item System shall take as input video streams of the defined format
    \item System shall output the video in the UI
    \item Codec: TBD
    \item Source: TBD
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System must interpret the telemetry data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item RocketView 3000 must interpret data from all relevant telemetry feeds.
    \item The system must output the interpreted data in a meaningful form for the UI described in \S 3.2.1
    \begin{itemize}
      \item data interpretation shall describe internal and external states of the vehicle, before, during, and after flight.
      \item Some data classifications are described in \url{https://github.com/psas/psas_packet}, but these classifations are likely to change.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Packet rate details TBD
    \item Packet contents TBD
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System must perform calculations on telemetry data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The system shall accept Vehicle Attitude and Vehicle Trajectory data.
    \item The system shall translate Vehicle Attitude and Vehicle Trajectory data into object or data structure representations that will be used by the UI.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System shall interpret APRS data}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item RV3K shall receive and interpret APRS data from recovery teams.
    \item RV3K shall output this data as input for the UI described in \S 2.2.1.
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{System should interpret rocket location}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item RV3K should isolate GPS data from the incoming data stream or extrapolate location from otherwise available data.
    \item The system should output the interpreted data as input for the UI described in \S 2.2.1
    \item This functionality should support logistics as covered in \S 1.3.1
  \end{itemize}
