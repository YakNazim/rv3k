\subsection{Assumptions and dependencies}
\subsubsection{RV3K is part of a bigger system}
  The RV3K module is one small piece in all the systems that are used during
  a PSAS launch. It is assumed that RV3K shall be used in tandem with launchcontrol
  and other software systems.

\subsubsection{Language and compiler dependencies}
  It is assumed that the user is comfortable following directions to install necessary
  language and/or compiler software as part of the setup for operating RV3K. These
  instructions shall be clearly documented.

\subsubsection{Version control}
  It is assumed that the user is comfortable updating software using GitHub and/or
  version control software. This includes updating a remote repository with configurations
  and modifications, and cloning, forking, and installing software from a GitHub repository.


\subsection{Links to social media}
  The RV3K module should provide links to PSAS social media. This includes Facebook,
  Twitter, or any other sites relevant to a given launch or phase of PSAS activity.
  It is assumed that these profiles are maintained separately from RV3K. RV3K shall
  be easily configurable to change such links when needed (see \S 2.3.5).
