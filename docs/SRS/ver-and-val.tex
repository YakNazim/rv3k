\subsection{Unit testing}
The unit tests shall:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure that the web UI is accessible on localhost
    \item Check that the Earth Frame View display is functioning properly
    \item Check that the Vehicle Attitude display is functioning properly
    \item Check that the Video Streams are functioning properly
    \item Ensure that the Telemetry data isn't being misinterpreted
    \item Check that the translated Vehicle Attitude and Vehicle Trajectory data is correct
    \item Ensure that the APRS data isn't being misinterpreted
    \item Provide meaningful messages for each failure mode
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Continuous integration}
The development process for RV3K will use a GitHub repository together with a
continuous integration tool (such as TravisCI).

\subsection{Replay testing}
The validation process for RV3K will use recorded and/or simulated data to improve the relevance of test results.

\subsection{Runtime error handling \& assertions}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item RV3K will employ assertions and/or exception handling to manage error states during run-time.
    \item In the event of an critical error, RV3K shall notify the user of the
    error and prefer halting
    rather than allow continued operation that may present erroneous or incorrect data.
    \item The system will restart to its most recent state after a crash occurs.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Logging and instrumentation}
RV3K will maintain plain text logs to facilitate debugging and diagnostic analysis.
