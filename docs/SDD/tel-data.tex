\section{Telemetry Data Module}

\subsection{Main View}
  Receives data through a socket opened to the telemetry server module, and
  pipes it to relevant directives that control visualization of the data on the
  main view of the page.

\subsection{At A Glance View}
  Receives data through a socket opened to the telemetry server module 
  to the At A Glance directive, which in turn uses Angular's 'ng-repeat' 
  directive to cycle through the data and serve it to At A Glance view of the
  page.
